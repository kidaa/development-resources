List of stuff, thought-dump mode:
* janek's explanation about alignment ([issue 3273](http://code.google.com/p/lilypond/issues/detail?id=3273))
* janek's [_LilyPond quick start_ tutorial](https://github.com/janek-warchol/warsztat-nutowy/blob/translation/english/uczenie/2%20wprowadzenie%20do%20LilyPonda.ly)
