What's this?
------------

A place to put miscellaneous LilyPond resources, notes, ideas, drafts, etc.
See READMEs in the subdirectories to learn what's stored there.

#### What's wrong with the mailing list?

Mailing list can be used for communication, but not for storing information.
With mailing list, useful stuff is scattered all over the archives -
we need a centralized place where one can easily find information
*and* update/expand it.  You cannot edit emails in the archive!

#### Why not use Lily's [CG](http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.19/Documentation/contributor/index.html)?

CG is part of LilyPond's official documentation, and submitting patches to LilyPond
is an involved process; going through official review for each change would be
way too much overhead.  Even if we allowed pushing such stuff without review,
we cannot give everyone push access to LilyPond's main repository.

#### But GitHub is not Free Software!

I've put the repo on GitHub because there's already a lot of LilyPond stuff there,
and because GitHub allows to very easily edit the documents using a web interface
(so that contributors don't have to know Git to add something).
If you know another place which could be used instead of GitHub, go ahead and lead
the change.
