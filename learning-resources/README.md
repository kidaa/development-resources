This folder will contain references to various places where one can learn more about
using LilyPond. It also contains a subfolder with unfinished LilyPond documentation.

Actually, this doesn't seem to fit the "development resources" description of the repository... maybe it should be moved someplace else later.


Listing of all interesting learning resources:
- Ben Lemon's ("Sound from sound") video tutorials
- Urs' blog Scheme tutorial
- Urs' plaintext essay
