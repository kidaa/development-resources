There are so many interesting materials showing how awesome Lilypond is
that it's hard to keep track of them.  This is an attempt to make a comprehensive
list of all stuff that can be useful when demonstrating LilyPond to other people.
Some things should be put inside this directory, some will be just linked to.

**TODO:** Ideally all entries should have a brief description and a link.


### Examples of complex scores typeset with LilyPond:

* compositions of Mike Solomon
* Les Nereides (included in Lily's regtests)
* schoenberg example from urs tutorial
* Fried Songs samples
* Urs dodecaphonic study for violin and piano
* an "Anton Webern-style" song by Urs


### Comparing LilyPond with other software

There's a category on LilyPond blog [dedicated to that]
(http://lilypondblog.org/category/comparisons/)

Engraving comparisons by Janek, in particular Eja Mater choral score.

### Advantages of text format

* Plaintext essay by Urs
* _Advanced workflows in scholarly editions_ by Janek&Urs
* voraussetzungen-und-m√∂glichkeiten.pdf by Urs (Urs, can you make this publicly available?)


### Particuarly awesome snippets

These shouldn't be hacks - they should demonstrate "legitimate" Lily features
with high "wow factor".

* mind-blowing tuplet numbers from David Nalesnik
* shapeII?
* coloring individual staff lines
* coloring notes based on scale step/pitch
* urs editorial hatches for Webern guys


### Miscellaneous

There's a category [LilyPond strengths](http://lilypondblog.org/category/strengths/)
on LilyPond blog.
